                <span class="big-l">S</span>o, possibly hottest and coolest thing now is social media. It's fun, It's entertaining, it's informative and it's the best timepass. But as always, everything has got its cons. And the cons of social media can be really dangerous sometimes.here I am bed-ridden, clutching my stomach in pain as I am suffering from a bout of food poisoning. I've been to the washroom umpteen times since late last night and now I realize being so greedy and having that chicken was not a good decision on my part. 
                <br>
                I'm writing after such a long time because my life has been insignificant. Not uneventful. Insignificant. At least I feel that way. 
                <br><br>
                I'm on vacation right now. Figuratively. Most of my batchmates are doing their internships right now. I'm not. Why? Simply because I didn't try enough. I'm not the same confident guy in school who goes up to people, makes contacts and knows how to take care of a situation. I've lost much of my self confidence. Unless people come up and approach me I've started to find it difficult to talk to people. Many will advise me to stop comparing myself to others and then I'll be happy. Bullshit. In today's world even if you stop comparing yourself, people will find a way to come up and rub their asses on your face. My batchmates never come up to just have a casual talk with me. I'm grateful to those who might message me after reading this but it will probably be only a one off conversation. And maybe I blame myself for that. 
                <br><br>
                My parents and I rarely talk these days. Meaningful talk. But they are sure to give a mention if a neighbor's kid or a relative goes abroad to study or does well in a CAT exam. Then they say that everybody around is succeeding and they are the one facing my descent. Funny thing. They never ever praised me when I did anything good on the other hand. Topping classes since childhood. Result? A gift they buy which I like maybe. But, after I grew up, I never wanted these gifts. I just wanted to hear them say that they're proud of me. I cleared JEE even when I was very ill on the day of the exam. Still nothing. No praise. Again I probably blame myself for not trying more. 
                <br><br>
                I do have many faults as well. I procrastinate a lot. I just can't get down to work somehow. It has turned into an illness of mine. I sit alone in my room at my laptop everyday, watching films, shows or reading. I have so many ideas of what I have to do so that I'm happier but I find no one to pull me out of the abyss I'm falling in. Just promises. And disappointment.
                <br><br>
                P.S.: This is not a suicide note. But I wish it were.
